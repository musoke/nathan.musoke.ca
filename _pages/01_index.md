I am a computational cosmologist, currently a postdoc in [Chanda Prescod-Weinstein](https://physics.unh.edu/people/faculty/chanda-prescod-weinstein)'s group at the University of New Hampshire.
My current research interests include fuzzy dark matter and [non-linear dynamics in the very early universe](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.061301).


I completed a PhD at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/) in 2020, supervised by [Richard Easther](https://www.physics.auckland.ac.nz/people/reas725), the [Perimeter Scholars International](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/training/about-psi) program at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca) & [University of Waterloo](https://www.uwaterloo.ca), and an undergraduate at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca).
