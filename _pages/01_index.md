I am a PhD student and aspiring cosmologist at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/), supervised by [Richard Easther](https://www.physics.auckland.ac.nz/people/reas725).
I completed an undergraduate degree at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca) and the [Perimeter Scholars International](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/training/about-psi) program at the [Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca) & [University of Waterloo](https://www.uwaterloo.ca).
My research interests include black holes, scalar polynomial invariants and the equivalence problem in general relativity.
I am now focusing on early universe cosmology.
