I have profiles on the following publication aggregaters:  

* [INSPIRE-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/author/profile/{{ site.INSPIRE_BAI }}) 
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user={{ site.google_scholar_user }})
* [ORCID](https://orcid.org/{{ site.ORCID_identifier }})  
* [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/inward/authorDetails.url?authorID={{ site.scopus_author_id }}&partnerID=MN8TOARS)
* [ResearcherID](https://www.researcherid.com/rid/{{ site.ResearcherID }})

Note that the last two do not include arXiv preprints and so will not be as up to date.


Below is a list of recent my publications as compiled by [INSPIRE-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/), the high energy physics information system.
